Okay, this sounds like a fun project! Let's plan out a simple, locally-hosted Pictionary game.

Here's a breakdown of the screens, functions, and a recommended tech stack:

### Screens

1.  **Lobby/Setup Screen:**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow players to join and start the game.
    *   **Elements:**
        *   Input field for player names.
        *   A list of players who have joined.
        *   A "Start Game" button (perhaps only visible to the first player or a designated host).

2.  **Game Screen (Drawer's View):**
    *   **Purpose:** For the person drawing.
    *   **Elements:**
        *   The secret word to draw.
        *   A drawing canvas (e.g., using HTML5 Canvas).
        *   Basic drawing tools (pen, eraser, color picker - keep it simple!).
        *   A timer for the round.
        *   A display of current guesses from other players (read-only for the drawer).
        *   Button to "Skip Word" (optional, might have a penalty or limit).

3.  **Game Screen (Guesser's View):**
    *   **Purpose:** For the players who are guessing.
    *   **Elements:**
        *   A view of the drawing canvas (updated in real-time).
        *   An input field to type guesses.
        *   A display of guesses made by all guessers (including their own).
        *   A timer for the round.
        *   A display of who is currently drawing.

4.  **Round Summary Screen:**
    *   **Purpose:** Displayed after each round.
    *   **Elements:**
        *   The word that was being drawn.
        *   Who guessed it correctly (if anyone).
        *   Updated scores for all players.
        *   A "Next Round" button.

5.  **Game Over Screen:**
    *   **Purpose:** Displayed when the game ends.
    *   **Elements:**
        *   Final scores.
        *   A "Play Again" button (which could take everyone back to the Lobby/Setup Screen).

### Core Functions

**Backend (Server-Side Logic):**

*   `initialize_game(player_names)`: Sets up the game with the list of players, initializes scores.
*   `start_new_round()`:
    *   Selects the next player to be the drawer.
    *   Picks a random word from a predefined list (e.g., a text file or an array).
    *   Resets the round timer.
    *   Notifies players about the new round and who is drawing.
*   `get_word_for_drawer()`: Provides the secret word only to the current drawer.
*   `broadcast_drawing_data(drawing_data)`: Receives drawing actions (lines, colors, etc.) from the drawer and sends them to all guessers in real-time.
*   `receive_guess(player_name, guess)`:
    *   Checks if the guess matches the secret word (case-insensitive, maybe some simple fuzzy matching for typos).
    *   If correct:
        *   Awards points to the guesser and drawer.
        *   Ends the round.
        *   Broadcasts that the word was guessed and by whom.
    *   If incorrect:
        *   Broadcasts the guess to all players.
*   `handle_timer_expiration()`: Ends the round if the timer runs out, reveals the word.
*   `manage_player_connections()`: Handle players joining and leaving.
*   `get_game_state()`: A function that clients can call (or the server pushes) to get the current state (scores, current drawer, drawing, etc.).

**Frontend (Client-Side Logic - JavaScript):**

*   **Drawer:**
    *   `send_drawing_data()`: Captures mouse/touch events on the canvas and sends coordinates/actions to the server.
    *   `render_drawing_tools()`: UI for selecting pen, color, eraser.
*   **Guesser:**
    *   `receive_drawing_data()`: Gets drawing data from the server and renders it on their local canvas.
    *   `submit_guess()`: Sends the typed guess to the server.
*   **Common:**
    *   `update_ui(game_state)`: Refreshes the screen display (timer, scores, whose turn it is, guesses, drawing).
    *   `handle_server_messages()`: Listens for messages from the server (new round, word guessed, drawing updates, etc.) and triggers UI updates.

### Tech Stack (Super Simple & Locally Hosted)

*   **Frontend (what runs in the browser):**
    *   **HTML:** For the structure of your pages.
    *   **CSS:** For styling and making it look nice.
    *   **JavaScript:** For all the client-side game logic, handling user input, drawing on the canvas, and communicating with the backend.
        *   **Canvas API:** For the drawing board.

*   **Backend (what runs on one person's computer and serves the game):**
    *   **Python** with **Flask** or **FastAPI**:
        *   **Why:** Python is relatively easy to get started with. Flask and FastAPI are lightweight web frameworks perfect for this kind of small application. They can serve the HTML/CSS/JS files and handle the game logic.
        *   You'll also need a WebSocket library for Python (e.g., `Flask-SocketIO` for Flask, or built-in support in FastAPI/Starlette).
    *   *Alternative: Node.js with Express.js:*
        *   **Why:** If you're more comfortable with JavaScript, Node.js allows you to write both your frontend and backend in the same language. Express.js is a popular framework, and libraries like `Socket.IO` are excellent for WebSockets.

*   **Real-time Communication:**
    *   **WebSockets:** This is essential for the real-time drawing updates and guess submissions. Both Python (with Flask-SocketIO or similar) and Node.js (with Socket.IO) have great support for WebSockets.

*   **Word List:**
    *   A simple **text file** (`words.txt`) where each line is a word. The backend will read from this file.
    *   Or, a hardcoded **array/list** of words directly in your backend code if the list isn't too long.

**How Local Hosting Works:**

1.  One person (the "host") runs the backend server application on their computer.
2.  The host finds their local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
3.  Other players on the same Wi-Fi network open their web browsers and go to `http://<host_ip_address>:<port>` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:5000` if Flask is running on port 5000).
4.  The backend server serves the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to everyone, and manages the game state and WebSocket connections.

This plan should give you a solid foundation. The key is to start with the most basic version (e.g., just getting drawing to broadcast, then adding guessing) and build up features incrementally.

Would you like to dive deeper into any specific part, like the structure of the Python/Flask app or how WebSockets might work in this context?
